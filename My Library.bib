  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods play a pivotal role in reducing the impact of uncertainties during both optimization and decision making processes. They have been applied to solve a variety of real-world problems in science and engineering. Bayesian approximation and ensemble learning techniques are two widely-used types of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. In this regard, researchers have proposed different UQ methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as computer vision (e.g., selfdriving cars and object detection), image processing (e.g., image restoration), medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation), natural language processing (e.g., text classification, social media texts and recidivism risk-scoring), bioinformatics, etc. This study reviews recent advances in UQ methods used in deep learning, investigates the application of these methods in reinforcement learning, and highlights fundamental research challenges and directions associated with UQ.},

  abstract = {This article develops a methodology for quantifying model risk in quantile risk estimates. The application of quantile estimates to risk assessment has become common practice in many disciplines, including hydrology, climate change, statistical process control, insurance and actuarial science, and the uncertainty surrounding these estimates has long been recognized. Our work is particularly important in finance, where quantile estimates (called Value-at-Risk) have been the cornerstone of banking risk management since the mid 1980s. A recent amendment to the Basel II Accord recommends additional market risk capital to cover all sources of ``model risk'' in the estimation of these quantiles. We provide a novel and elegant framework whereby quantile estimates are adjusted for model risk, relative to a benchmark which represents the state of knowledge of the authority that is responsible for model risk. A simulation experiment in which the degree of model risk is controlled illustrates how to quantify Value-at-Risk model risk and compute the required regulatory capital add-on for banks. An empirical example based on real data shows how the methodology can be put into practice, using only two time series (daily Value-at-Risk and daily profit and loss) from a large bank. We conclude with a discussion of potential applications to nonfinancial risks.},

  abstract = {The need to turn to more environmentally friendly sources of energy has led energy systems to focus on renewable sources of energy. Wind power has been a widely used source of green energy. However, the wind's stochastic and unpredictable behavior has created several challenges to the operation and stability of energy systems. Forecasting models have been developed and excessively used in recent decades in order to deal with these challenges. Deterministic forecasting models have been the main focus of researchers and are still being developed in order to improve their accuracy. Furthermore, in recent years, in order to observe and study the uncertainty of forecasts, probabilistic forecasting models have been developed in order to give a wider view of the possible prediction outcomes. Advanced probabilistic and deterministic forecasting models could be used in order to facilitate the energy systems operation and energy markets management. This paper introduces an overview of state-of-the-art wind power deterministic and probabilistic models, developing a comparative evaluation between the different models reviewed, identifying their advantages and disadvantages, classifying and analyzing current and future research directions in this area.},

A multivariate model was proposed to improve the accuracy of wind power generation prediction in order to induce system operators to reduce risks. The model consists of three steps. First, the meteorological data such as wind speed are predicted by LSTM networks on the basis of traditional time series approaches. Then a method of similar time series matching with hierarchical search is proposed to highlight the main factors and save computing time. We use similar disparity as a criterion to select similar meteorological series and power data as training sets. Finally, similar data are inputted into LightGBM for modeling, training, and prediction. Industrial data of the wind power plant is examined case. The results are clearly display that the proposed method can effectively predict wind power in the next 6 hours and achieve high precision, which has certain engineering practical value.},

The former employs deep neural networks that utilize probabilistic layers which can represent and process uncertainty; the latter uses probabilistic models that incorporate deep neural network components which capture complex non-linear stochastic relationships between the random variables. We discuss some major examples of each approach including Bayesian neural networks and mixture density networks (for probabilistic neural networks), and variational autoencoders, deep Gaussian processes and deep mixed effects models (for deep probabilistic models).

  abstract = {Accurate wind power prediction is crucial for the safe and stable operation of the power grid. However, wind power generation has large random volatility and intermittency, which increases the difficulty of prediction. In order to construct an effective prediction model based on wind power generation power and achieve stable grid dispatch after wind power is connected to the grid, a wind power generation prediction model based on WT-BiGRU-Attention-TCN is proposed. First, wavelet transform (WT) is used to reduce noises of the sample data. Then, the temporal attention mechanism is incorporated into the bi-directional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) model to highlight the impact of key time steps on the prediction results while fully extracting the temporal features of the context. Finally, the model performance is enhanced by further extracting more high-level temporal features through a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN). The results show that our proposed model outperforms other baseline models, achieving a root mean square error of 0.066 MW, a mean absolute percentage error of 18.876\%, and the coefficient of determination (R               2               ) reaches 0.976. It indicates that the noise-reduction WT technique can significantly improve the model performance, and also shows that using the temporal attention mechanism and TCN can further improve the prediction accuracy.},

Forecasting renewable energy sources has therefore become essential in balancing the power grid. While a lot of focus is placed on new forecasting methods, little attention is given on how to compare, reproduce and transfer the methods to other use cases and data. One reason for this lack of attention is the limited availability of open-source datasets, as many currently used datasets are non-disclosed and make reproducibility of research impossible. This unavailability of open-source datasets is especially prevalent in commercially interesting fields such as wind power forecasting. However, with this paper, we want to enable researchers to compare their methods on publicly available datasets by providing the, to our knowledge, largest up-to-date overview of existing open-source wind power datasets, and a categorization into different groups of datasets that can be used for wind power forecasting. We show that there are publicly available datasets sufficient for wind power forecasting tasks and discuss the different data groups properties to enable researchers to choose appropriate opensource datasets and compare their methods on them.},

Compared with conventional mean regression, QR can characterize the entire conditional distribution of the outcome variable, may be more robust to outliers and misspecification of error distribution, and provides more comprehensive statistical modeling than traditional mean regression. QR models could not only be used to detect heterogeneous effects of covariates at different quantiles of the outcome, but also offer more robust and complete estimates compared to the mean regression, when the normality assumption violated or outliers and long tails exist. These advantages make QR attractive and are extended to apply for different types of data, including independent data, time-to-event data and longitudinal data. Consequently, we present a brief review of QR and its related models and methods for different types of data in various application areas.},

Therefore, a lot of new forecasting methods have been put forward. In this paper, a new forecasting model based on a convolution neural network and LightGBM is constructed.

Second, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to extract information from input data, and the network parameters are adjusted by comparing the actual results. Third, in consideration of the limitations of the single-convolution model in predicting wind power, we innovatively integrated the LightGBM classification algorithm at the model to improve the forecasting accuracy and robustness. Finally, compared with the existing support vector machines, LightGBM, and CNN, the fusion model has better performance in accuracy and efficiency.},

However, the elusive nature of wind, influenced by various meteorological and geographical factors, greatly complicates the wind power forecasting task. To improve the forecasting accuracy of wind power (WP), we propose a BERT-based model for spatio-temporal forecasting (BERT4ST), which is the first approach to fine-tune a large language model for the spatio-temporal modeling of WP. To deal with the inherent characteristics of WP, BERT4ST exploits the individual spatial and temporal dependency of patches and redesigns a set of spatial and temporal encodings. By well analyzing the connection between bidirectional attention networks and WP spatio-temporal data, BERT4ST employs a pre-trained BERT encoder as the backbone network to learn the individual spatial and temporal dependency of patches of WP data. Additionally, BERT4ST fine-tunes the pre-trained backbone in a multi-stage manner, i.e., first aligning the language model with the spatio-temporal data and then fine-tuning the downstream tasks while maintaining the stability of the backbone network. Experimental results demonstrate that our BERT4ST achieves desirable performance compared to some state-of-the-art methods.},

Accurate wind power forecasting holds immense significance as it facilitates the development of future generation plans, enhances the economy and reliability of power systems, and promotes the increased utilization of clean energy. However, an abundance of anomalous data stems from harsh turbine environments. The interplay among natural wind patterns, artificial interventions, and turbine states results in poor cyclicality and significant volatility in wind power generation. To address these challenges, we propose the WPFormer framework. Within this framework, we have designed a Wind powEr Dual-stream Scoring model (WEDS), a semi-supervised learning model based on wind power curves, tasked with anomaly detection and data repair. A Feature sElection methoD based on the Self-attention mechanism, known as FEDS, is also proposed for identifying valuable features. Furthermore, the spatial information of the wind turbines is introduced, and multiple series decomposition with autocorrelation and multi-headed attention is used to learn the expected prediction behind the randomness, overcome the weak periodicity, and predict the long-term significant volatility trend. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that WPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

A dual-channel network architecture, based on the integration of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Informer, is proposed in this study to improve the accuracy of wind power forecasting. Unlike traditional Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) techniques, the wind power sequence is first decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using VMD. Subsequently, sample entropy is innovatively utilized to classify the decomposed IMFs into two groups of differing complexity. Following this, both the emerging Informer and TCN models are concurrently applied to wind power forecasting, constituting the core methodology of this research. Based on the operational mechanisms of the two models, two integrated model architectures, Informer and TCN-Informer, are designed for the two groups of modes to extract feature information from the low-complexity and high-complexity mode groups, respectively. Finally, the prediction results of each IMF are aggregated and reconstructed to obtain the final forecast. We utilized a large-scale wind power dataset to train and test the proposed models, conducting predictions 15 min and 1 h in advance. The applicability of the models across different datasets was also validated. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to commonly used wind power forecasting methods, the dual-channel architecture based on TCN and Informer models exhibits higher prediction accuracy and performance.},

The LSTM network is designed to effectively exhibit the dynamic behavior of the wind power time series. The discrete wavelet transform is introduced to decompose the non-stationary wind power time series into several components which have more stationarity and are easier to predict. Each component is dug by an independent LSTM. The forecasting results of the wind power are obtained by synthesizing the prediction values of all components. The prediction accuracy has been improved by the proposed method, which is validated by the MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), and RMSE (root mean square error) of experimental results of three wind farms as the benchmarks. Wind power forecasting based on the proposed method provides an alternative way to improve the security and stability of the electric power network with the high penetration of wind power.},

The adopted strategies are individual artificial neural network (ANN) and hybrid strategy based on the physical and the statistical methods. The performance of two prediction methods is comprehensively compared. The calculated results show that the individual ANN prediction method can yield the prediction results quickly. The prediction accuracy is low and the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 10.67\%. By contrast the hybrid prediction method operates costly and slowly. However, the prediction accuracy is high and the RMSE is 2.01\%, less than 1/5 of that by individual ANN method. Meanwhile, it is found that the errors of the prediction have some relation with the wind speeds. The prediction errors are small when the wind speeds lower than 5 m/s or higher than 15 m/s.

The proposed method uses the information from the control system, such as the cut-in and rated speeds of the turbines. The wind speeds are divided into three segments based on this information. The proposed method probabilistically predicts the segment each turbine belongs to at the first stage using a neural network (NN). Subsequently, the method generates samples representing the predicted power outputs for the three segments independently and integrates them according to the predicted probability of each segment at the second stage. An NN with Monte Carlo dropout is used for the generation of prediction samples in the segment from the cut-in to rated speeds, whereas constant values based on the control information of each turbine are used for the predicted power outputs in other segments. We present a case study in which the proposed method is applied to real wind farm and weather forecast data. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated in terms of the prediction interval as well as the expected prediction value.},

Consequently, accurate prediction is extremely preferred for planning reliable and effective execution of power systems and to guarantee the continuous supply. For this purpose, a novel genetic long short term memory (GLSTM) framework comprising of long short term memory and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to predict short-term wind power. In the proposed GLSTM model, the strength of LSTM is employed due to its capability of automatically learning features from sequential data, while the global optimization strategy of GA is exploited to optimize window size and number of neurons in LSTM layers. Prediction from GLSTM has been compared with actual power, predictions of support vector regressor, and with reported techniques in terms of standard performance indices. It can be evaluated from the comparison that GLSTM and its variants provide accurate, reliable, and robust predictions of wind power of seven wind farms in Europe. In terms of percentage improvement, GLSTM, on average, improves wind power predictions from 6\% to 30\% as opposed to existing techniques. Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrates that GLSTM is significantly different from standard LSTM.},

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a wind power prediction model incorporating Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN), Sample Entropy (SE), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and a Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Neural NetworkTransformer (BiTCN-TR). The model first applies CEEMDAN to decompose the wind power series into multiple modes. SE is then used to identify the most complex IMF, which is further decomposed using VMD to enhance stationarity in the wind power series. Finally, BiTCN-TR is applied to predict each component, and the predicted results are superimposed to obtain the final wind power forecast. To verify the reliability and applicability of the model, simulation experiments were conducted on cases from three different regions. The analysis show that for the low-volatility dataset, the MAPE is 1.662 \% and the RMSE is 1.381 kW. For the medium-volatility dataset, the MAPE is 1.901 \% and the RMSE is 0.58 kW. For the medium-to-high-volatility dataset, the MAPE is 1.870 \% and the RMSE is 0.64 kW. These results demonstrate that the model maintains relatively high forecasting accuracy and stability across different volatility levels.},

However, the accuracy of power forecasting results is easily impaired by the insufficient capacity of sequence modeling and misleading information from distinct wind turbines. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to resolve the mentioned problem. Specifically, the reliability of wind condition knowledge is enhanced by considering the spatial information of surrounding wind turbines. Moreover, two metrics based on the distance and correlation are developed to evaluate the quality of spatial information. To learn sequential dependencies regardless of the distance, wind power modeling is achieved by transformer neural networks based on the multi-head attention mechanism. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method with real-world measurements. Results show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline and state-of-the-art approaches, and the superiority is particularly prominent with large steps. In two experiments, the average values of mean absolute error of forecasting results generated by the proposed method are only 0.0914 and 0.0911, respectively, which is significantly better than other approaches. With accurate results of short-term multi-step forecasting, this work makes contributions to the effective utilization of wind energy resources.},

Increased utilization of wind energy sources calls for more robust and efficient prediction models to mitigate uncertainties associated with wind power. This research compares two different approaches in wind power forecasting which are indirect and direct prediction methods. In indirect method, several times series are applied to forecast the wind speed, whereas the logistic function with five parameters is then used to forecast the wind power. In this study, backtracking search algorithm with novel crossover and mutation operators is employed to find the best parameters of five-parameter logistic function. A new feature selection technique, combining the mutual information and neural network is proposed in this paper to extract the most informative features with a maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy. From the comparative study, the results demonstrate that, in the direct prediction approach where the historical weather data are used to predict the wind power generation directly, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system outperforms five data mining algorithms namely, random forest, M5Rules, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine and multilayer perceptron. Moreover, it is also found that the mean absolute percentage error of the direct prediction method using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system is 1.47\% which is approximately less than half of the error obtained with the indirect prediction methods.},

However, previous studies have primarily focused on data preprocessing or model optimization, often neglecting the challenge of efficiently forecasting wind power for newly built wind farms with limited historical data. To address this issue, we developed a novel wind power forecasting system consisting of six modules that leverage a transformer network and a parameter-sharing transfer learning strategy, with a strong emphasis on model interpretability. In this forecasting system, the feature selection module and attention mechanism work together to identify key features from the input set and assign importance weights to each selected feature rather than treating all features equally. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting system, we conducted three simulation experiments using ten multivariate datasets from two wind farms in China. The results were compared against six benchmarks and various feature selection methods. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed wind power forecasting system outperforms all benchmarks. On average, across the three experiments, it achieved considerable performance improvements of 46.29\% in mean absolute error and 31.02\% in root mean square error compared to the worst-performing multi-layer perceptron. Additionally, the implementation of the transfer learning strategy markedly enhanced the forecasting system's accuracy, leading to average reductions of 13.84\% in mean absolute error and 7.77\% in root mean square error.},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable probabilistic wind power and wind speed forecasts provide large amounts of uncertainty information, which is important for wind farm management and grid dispatch optimization. In this study, a dynamic non-constraint ensemble model is proposed to generate probabilistic wind power and wind speed forecasts. First, four deep Gaussian neural networks (DGNNs) based on popular time series forecasting approaches and the maximum likelihood estimation-based loss function are designed to generate base probabilistic forecasts in the ensemble model. Second, to consider the overall uncertainty of base probabilistic forecasts, a novel ensemble strategy for probabilistic forecasting is derived based on the probability density function of the weighted sum of finite Gaussian random variables. Third, to obtain the ensemble weights for different base probabilistic forecasts, a dynamic non-constraint weight learning model, containing quantile function, convolutional neural network, and channel attention, is proposed to generate dynamic non-constraint ensemble weights. In addition, the maximal information coefficient, which measures the linear and nonlinear relationship between the historical wind data and the target, is used for selecting the optimal input length. The experimental results from four real-world wind datasets demonstrate that the proposed ensemble model achieves exceptional accuracy in probabilistic wind power and wind speed forecasting. It outperforms DGNNs by an average improvement of 4.9325 \% in pinball loss and surpasses Gaussian process regression by 16.6382 \%. The effectiveness of utilizing non-constraint ensemble weights is supported by the results obtained with different weight constraints. Furthermore, hypothesis testing further confirms the overall effectiveness of the proposed ensemble model.},

However, the inherent uncertainty in wind power poses significant challenges to reliable forecasting. While self-attention mechanisms and kernel density estimation (KDE) have been widely utilized in WPF, further improvements in model performance remains a tough task. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a novel deterministic WPF model that incorporates Lorenz noisebased data augmentation and the probsparse self-attention-based Informer. The model interpretability is further enhanced by providing insights into the contribution of input features through shapley additive explanations (SHAP). For probabilistic forecasting, the model is optimized using power scenarios and the multi-bandwidth kernel density estimation (MBKDE) method. Finally, a case study involving 5 wind farms is conducted. The results demonstrate a 13.44\% improvement in deterministic forecast accuracy compared to the benchmark, with an additional 1.35\% improvement following data augmentation. Interpretability analysis shows that adding 7 iterations of Lorenz noise enhances forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, the probabilistic forecasting model shows an improvement of at least 2.89\% in overall performance.},

Accurate prediction of wind power is of great significance to the safety of wind power grid connection. This study proposes a novel spatio-temporal correlation model (STCM) for ultra-short-term wind power prediction based on convolutional neural networks-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). The original meteorological factors at multi-historical time points of different sites throughout the target wind farm can be reconstructed into the input window of the model, and thus a new data reconstruction method is represented. CNN is used to extract the spatial correlation feature vectors of meteorological factors of different sites and the temporal correlation vectors of the meteorological features in ultra-short term, which are reconstructed in time series and used as the input data of LSTM. Then, LSTM extracts the temporal feature relationship between the historical time points for multi-step wind power forecasting. The STCM based on CNN-LSTM proposed in this study is suitable for wind farms that can collect meteorological factors at different locations. Taking the measured meteorological factors and wind power dataset of a wind farm in China as an example, four evaluation metrics of the CNN-LSTM model, CNN and LSTM individually used for multi-step wind power prediction, are obtained. The results show that the proposed STCM based on CNN-LSTM has better spatial and temporal characteristics extraction ability than the traditional structure model and can forecast the power of wind farm more accurately.},

  abstract = {The randomness and intermittence of wind resources is the biggest challenge in the integration of wind power into the power system. Accurate forecasting of wind power generation is an efficient tool to deal with such problem. Conventional wind power forecasting produces a value, or the conditional expectation of wind power output at a time point in the future. However, any prediction involves inherent uncertainty. In recent years, several probabilistic forecasting approaches have been reported in wind power forecasting studies. Compared to currently wide-used point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts could provide additional quantitative information on the uncertainty associated with wind power generation. For decision-makings in the uncertainty environment, probabilistic forecasts are optimal inputs. A review of state-of-the-art methods and new developments in wind power probabilistic forecasting is presented in this paper. Firstly, three different representations of wind power uncertainty are briefly introduced. Then, different forecasting methods are discussed. These methods are classified into three categories in terms of uncertainty representation, i.e. probabilistic forecasts (parametric and non-parametric), risk index forecasts and space-time scenario forecasts. Finally, requirements and the overall framework of the uncertainty forecasting evaluation are summarized. In addition, this article also describes current challenges and future developments associated with wind power probabilistic prediction.},
